# vyos-1x: VyOS command definitions, configuration scripts, and data

VyOS 1.1.x had its codebase split into way too many submodules for no good
reason, which made it hard to navigate or write meaningful changelogs. As the
code undergoes rewrite in the new style in VyOS 1.2.0+, we consolidate the
rewritten code in this package.

If you just want to build a VyOS image, the repository you want is
[vyos-build](https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build). If you also want to contribute
to VyOS, read on.

## Package layout

```

debian                 # Our package build system
interface-definitions  # Configuration interface (i.e. conf mode command) definitions
op-mode-definitions    # Operational command definitions
python                 # Programming library for accessing the config frontend/backend
schema                 # XML schema definition for conf mode and op mode commands
scripts                # Build-time scripts

## Interface/command definitions

Raw `node.def` files for the old backend are no longer written by hand or
generated by custom scripts. They are all now produced from a unified XML format
that supports a strict subset of the old backend features. In particular, it
intentionally does not support embedded shell scripts, default values, and value
"types", instead delegating those tasks to external scripts.

Configuration interface definitions must conform to the schema found in
`schema/interface_definition.rng` and operational command definitions must
conform to `schema/op-mode-definition.rng`. Schema checks are performed at build
time, so a package with malformed interface definitions will not build.

## Configuration scripts

The guidelines in a nutshell:

* Use separate functions for retrieving configuration data, validating it, and
  generating taret config, see our
  [documentation](https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/contributing/development.html#python)
  for the common structure
* Use the `get_config_dict()` API as much as possible when retrieving values from the CLI
* Use a template processor when the format is more complex than just one line
  (our standard is Jinja2)

## Tests

Tests are executed at build time, you can also execute them by hand with:

```
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
make test
```

### Runtime (Smoke Tests)

Runtime tests are executed by the CI system on a running VyOS instance inside
QEMU. The testcases can be found inside the smoketest subdirectory which will
be placed into the vyos-1x-smoketest package.
