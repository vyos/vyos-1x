    """ Converts number of days since UNIX epoch
        to the Maya calendar date.

        Ancient Maya people used three independent calendars for
        different purposes.

        The long count calendar is for recording historical events.
        It represents the number of days passed
        since some date in the past the Maya believed is the day
        our world was created.
          
        Tzolkin calendar is for religious purposes, it has
        two independent cycles of 13 and 20 days, where 13 day
        cycle days are numbered, and 20 day cycle days are named.
      
        Haab calendar is for agriculture and daily life, it's a
        365 day calendar with 18 months 20 days each, and 5
        nameless days.

        The smallest unit of the long count calendar is one day (kin).
     
    """

    """ The long count calendar uses five different base 18 or base 20
        cycles. Modern scholars write long count calendar dates in a dot separated format
        from longest to shortest cycle,
            <baktun>.<katun>.<tun>.<winal>.<kin>
        for example, "13.0.0.9.2".

        Classic version actually used by the ancient Maya wraps around
        every 13th baktun, but modern historians often use longer cycles
        such as piktun = 20 baktun.
