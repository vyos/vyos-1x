# T3417: migrate BGP tagNode to node as we can only have one BGP process

from vyos.configtree import ConfigTree

def migrate(config: ConfigTree) -> None:
    base = ['protocols', 'bgp']

    if not config.exists(base) or not config.is_tag(base):
        # Nothing to do
        return

    # Only one BGP process is supported, thus this operation is savea

    # We need a temporary copy of the config

    config.rename(tmp_base, 'bgp')
