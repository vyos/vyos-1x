# T4694: Adding rt ipsec exists/missing match to firewall configs.
# This involves a syntax change for IPsec matches, reflecting that different 
# nftables expressions are required depending on whether we're matching a 
# decrypted packet or a packet that will be encrypted - it's directional. 
# The old rules only matched decrypted packets, those matches are now *-in:
    # from: set firewall <family> <chainspec> rule <rule#> ipsec match-ipsec|match-none
    #   to: set firewall <family> <chainspec> rule <rule#> ipsec match-ipsec-in|match-none-in
#
# The <chainspec> positions this match allowed were:
# name (any custom chains), forward filter, input filter, prerouting raw.
# There are positions where it was possible to set, but it would never commit 
# (nftables rejects 'meta ipsec' in output hooks), they are not considered here.
#
