# "multi" tag means a node can have one or more values,
# "valueless" means it can have no values at all.
# "hidden" means node visibility can be toggled, eg 'dangerous' commands,
# "secret" allows a node to hide its value from unprivileged users.
#
# "priority" is used to influence node processing order for nodes
# with exact same dependencies and in compatibility modes.
