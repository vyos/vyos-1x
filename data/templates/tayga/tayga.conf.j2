# TUN device that TAYGA will use to exchange IPv4 and IPv6 packets with the
# kernel.  You may use any name you like, but `nat64' is recommended.
#
# This device may be created before starting the tayga daemon by running
# `tayga --mktun`.  This allows routing and firewall rules to be set up prior
# to commencement of packet translation.
#
# Mandatory.
#

#
# TAYGA's IPv4 address.  This is NOT your router's IPv4 address!  TAYGA
# requires its own address because it acts as an IPv4 and IPv6 router, and
# needs to be able to send ICMP messages.  TAYGA will also respond to ICMP
# echo requests (ping) at this address.
#
# This address can safely be located inside the dynamic-pool prefix.
#
# Mandatory.

# TAYGA's IPv6 address.  This is NOT your router's IPv6 address!  TAYGA
# requires its own address because it acts as an IPv4 and IPv6 router, and
# needs to be able to send ICMP messages.  TAYGA will also respond to ICMP
# echo requests (ping6) at this address.
#
# You can leave ipv6-addr unspecified and TAYGA will construct its IPv6
# address using ipv4-addr and the NAT64 prefix.
#
# Optional if the NAT64 prefix is specified, otherwise mandatory.  It is also
# mandatory if the NAT64 prefix is 64:ff9b::/96 and ipv4-addr is a private
# (RFC1918) address.

#
# The NAT64 prefix.  The IPv4 address space is mapped into the IPv6 address
# space by prepending this prefix to the IPv4 address.  Using a /96 prefix is
# recommended in most situations, but all lengths specified in RFC 6052 are
# supported.
#
# This must be a prefix selected from your organization's IPv6 address space
# or the Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96.  Note that using the Well-Known
# Prefix will prohibit IPv6 hosts from contacting IPv4 hosts that have private
# (RFC1918) addresses, per RFC 6052.
#
# The NAT64 prefix need not be specified if all required address mappings are
# listed in `map' directives.  (See below.)
#
# Optional.

#
# Dynamic pool prefix.  IPv6 hosts which send traffic through TAYGA (and do
# not correspond to a static map or an IPv4-translatable address in the NAT64
# prefix) will be assigned an IPv4 address from the dynamic pool.  Dynamic
# maps are valid for 124 minutes after the last matching packet is seen.
#
# If no unassigned addresses remain in the dynamic pool (or no dynamic pool is
# configured), packets from unknown IPv6 hosts will be rejected with an ICMP
# unreachable error.
#
# Optional.

# Persistent data storage directory.  The dynamic.map file, which saves the
# dynamic maps that are created from dynamic-pool, is stored in this
# directory.  Omit if you do not need these maps to be persistent between
# instances of TAYGA.
#
# Optional.
#
data-dir /run/tayga/{{ ifname }}.d

#
# Establishes a single-host map.  If an IPv6 host should be consistently
# reachable at a specific IPv4 address, the mapping can be specified in a
# `map' directive.  (IPv6 hosts numbered with an IPv4-translatable address do
# not need map directives.)
#
# IPv4 addresses specified in the `map' directive can safely be located inside
# the dynamic-pool prefix.
#
# Optional.
