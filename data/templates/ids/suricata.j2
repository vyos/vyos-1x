##
## Step 1: Inform Suricata about your network
##

vars:
  # more specific is better for alert accuracy and performance
  address-groups:
{% for (name, value) in suricata['address_group'] %}
    {{ name }}: "[{{ value | join(',') }}]"
{% endfor %}

  port-groups:
{% for (name, value) in suricata['port_group'] %}
    {{ name }}: "[{{ value | join(',') }}]"
{% endfor %}

##
## Step 2: Select outputs to enable
##

# The default logging directory.  Any log or output file will be
# placed here if it's not specified with a full path name. This can be
# overridden with the -l command line parameter.
default-log-dir: /var/log/suricata/

# Configure the type of alert (and other) logging you would like.

##
## Step 3: Configure common capture settings
##
## See "Advanced Capture Options" below for more options, including Netmap
## and PF_RING.
##

# Linux high speed capture support
af-packet:
{% for interface in suricata.interface %}
  - interface: {{ interface }}
    # Default clusterid. AF_PACKET will load balance packets based on flow.
    cluster-id: {{ 100 - loop.index }}
    # Default AF_PACKET cluster type. AF_PACKET can load balance per flow or per hash.
    # This is only supported for Linux kernel > 3.1
    # possible value are:
    #  * cluster_flow: all packets of a given flow are sent to the same socket
    #  * cluster_cpu: all packets treated in kernel by a CPU are sent to the same socket
    #  * cluster_qm: all packets linked by network card to a RSS queue are sent to the same
    #  socket. Requires at least Linux 3.14.
    #  * cluster_ebpf: eBPF file load balancing. See doc/userguide/capture-hardware/ebpf-xdp.rst for
    #  more info.
    # Recommended modes are cluster_flow on most boxes and cluster_cpu or cluster_qm on system
    # with capture card using RSS (requires cpu affinity tuning and system IRQ tuning)
    cluster-type: cluster_flow
    # In some fragmentation cases, the hash can not be computed. If "defrag" is set
    # to yes, the kernel will do the needed defragmentation before sending the packets.
    defrag: yes
{% endfor %}

# Cross platform libpcap capture support
pcap:
{% for interface in suricata.interface %}
  - interface: {{ interface }}
{% endfor %}

# Settings for reading pcap files
pcap-file:
  # Possible values are:
  #  - yes: checksum validation is forced
  #  - no: checksum validation is disabled
  #  - auto: Suricata uses a statistical approach to detect when
  #  checksum off-loading is used. (default)
  # Warning: 'checksum-validation' must be set to yes to have checksum tested
  checksum-checks: auto

# See "Advanced Capture Options" below for more options, including Netmap
# and PF_RING.


##
## Step 4: App Layer Protocol configuration
##

# Configure the app-layer parsers.
#
# The error-policy setting applies to all app-layer parsers. Values can be
# "drop-flow", "pass-flow", "bypass", "drop-packet", "pass-packet", "reject" or
# "ignore" (the default).
#
# The protocol's section details each protocol.
#
# The option "enabled" takes 3 values - "yes", "no", "detection-only".
# "yes" enables both detection and the parser, "no" disables both, and
# "detection-only" enables protocol detection only (parser disabled).

      #            'content' signatures.
      # - bypass:  stop processing this flow as much as possible. No further
      #            TLS parsing and inspection. Offload flow bypass to kernel
      #            or hardware if possible.
      # - full:    keep tracking and inspection as normal. Unmodified content
      #            keyword signatures are inspected as well.
      #
      # For best performance, select 'bypass'.

# prune before clearing the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing new flows to be created, but

# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doesn't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more aggressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the oldest flows using
# last time seen flows.
# The memcap can be specified in kb, mb, gb.  Just a number indicates it's

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determines the seconds to wait after a handshake or
# stream startup before the engine frees the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if that time elapses
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero). "bypassed"
# timeout controls locally bypassed flows. For these flows we don't do any other
# tracking. If no packets have been seen after this timeout, the flow is discarded.
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables

## Performance tuning and profiling
##

# The detection engine builds internal groups of signatures. The engine
# allows us to specify the profile to use for them, to manage memory in an
# efficient way keeping good performance. For the profile keyword you
# can use the words "low", "medium", "high" or "custom". If you use custom,
# make sure to define the values in the "custom-values" section.
# Usually you would prefer medium/high/low.
#
# "sgh mpm-context", indicates how the staging should allot mpm contexts for
# the signature groups.  "single" indicates the use of a single context for
# all the signature group heads.  "full" indicates a mpm-context for each
# group head.  "auto" lets the engine decide the distribution of contexts
# based on the information the engine gathers on the patterns from each
# group head.
#
# The option inspection-recursion-limit is used to limit the recursive calls
# in the content inspection code.  For certain payload-sig combinations, we
# might end up taking too much time in the content inspection code.
# If the argument specified is 0, the engine uses an internally defined
# default limit.  When a value is not specified, there are no limits on the recursion.

## Netfilter integration
##

# When running in NFQ inline mode, it is possible to use a simulated
# non-terminal NFQUEUE verdict.
# This permits sending all needed packet to Suricata via this rule:
#        iptables -I FORWARD -m mark ! --mark $MARK/$MASK -j NFQUEUE
# And below, you can have your standard filtering ruleset. To activate
# this mode, you need to set mode to 'repeat'
# If you want a packet to be sent to another queue after an ACCEPT decision
# set the mode to 'route' and set next-queue value.
# On Linux >= 3.1, you can set batchcount to a value > 1 to improve performance
# by processing several packets before sending a verdict (worker runmode only).
# On Linux >= 3.6, you can set the fail-open option to yes to have the kernel
# accept the packet if Suricata is not able to keep pace.
# bypass mark and mask can be used to implement NFQ bypass. If bypass mark is
# set then the NFQ bypass is activated. Suricata will set the bypass mark/mask
# on packet of a flow that need to be bypassed. The Nefilter ruleset has to
# directly accept all packets of a flow once a packet has been marked.

# Please make sure you have ipfw_load="YES" and ipdivert_load="YES"

# Additionally, you need to have an ipfw rule for the engine to see
# the packets from ipfw.  For Example:
#
#   ipfw add 100 divert 8000 ip from any to any
#
# N.B. This example uses "8000" -- this number must mach the values

  # accepted packets are reinjected at the divert rule which they entered
  # and IPFW rule processing continues.  No check is done to verify
  # this will rule makes sense so care must be taken to avoid loops in ipfw.
  #

    # The streams to listen on when auto-config is disabled or when and threading
    # cpu-affinity is disabled.  This can be either:
    #   an individual stream (e.g. streams: [0])
    # or
    #   a range of streams (e.g. streams: ["0-3"])
    #
    streams: ["0-3"]

    # Stream stats can be enabled to provide fine grain packet and byte counters
    # for each thread/stream that is configured.
    #
    enable-stream-stats: no

    # When auto-config is enabled the streams will be created and assigned
    # automatically to the NUMA node where the thread resides.  If cpu-affinity
    # is enabled in the threading section.  Then the streams will be created
    # according to the number of worker threads specified in the worker-cpu-set.
    # Otherwise, the streams array is used to define the streams.
    #
    # This option is intended primarily to support legacy configurations.
    #
    # This option cannot be used simultaneously with either "use-all-streams"
    # or "hardware-bypass".
    #
    auto-config: yes

    # Enable hardware level flow bypass.
    #
    hardware-bypass: yes

    # Enable inline operation.  When enabled traffic arriving on a given port is
    # automatically forwarded out its peer port after analysis by Suricata.
    #
    inline: no

    # Ports indicates which Napatech ports are to be used in auto-config mode.
    # these are the port IDs of the ports that will be merged prior to the
    # traffic being distributed to the streams.
    #
    # When hardware-bypass is enabled the ports must be configured as a segment.
    # specify the port(s) on which upstream and downstream traffic will arrive.
    # This information is necessary for the hardware to properly process flows.
    #
    # When using a tap configuration one of the ports will receive inbound traffic
    # for the network and the other will receive outbound traffic. The two ports on a
    # given segment must reside on the same network adapter.
    #
    # When using a SPAN-port configuration the upstream and downstream traffic
    # arrives on a single port. This is configured by setting the two sides of the
    # segment to reference the same port.  (e.g. 0-0 to configure a SPAN port on
    # port 0).
    #
    # port segments are specified in the form:
    #    ports: [0-1,2-3,4-5,6-6,7-7]
    #
    # For legacy systems when hardware-bypass is disabled this can be specified in any
    # of the following ways:
    #
    #   a list of individual ports (e.g. ports: [0,1,2,3])
    #
    #   a range of ports (e.g. ports: [0-3])
    #
    #   "all" to indicate that all ports are to be merged together
    #   (e.g. ports: [all])
    #
    # This parameter has no effect if auto-config is disabled.
    #
    ports: [0-1,2-3]

    # When auto-config is enabled the hashmode specifies the algorithm for
    # determining to which stream a given packet is to be delivered.
    # This can be any valid Napatech NTPL hashmode command.
    #
    # The most common hashmode commands are:  hash2tuple, hash2tuplesorted,
    # hash5tuple, hash5tuplesorted and roundrobin.
    #
    # See Napatech NTPL documentation other hashmodes and details on their use.
    #
    # This parameter has no effect if auto-config is disabled.
    #
    hashmode: hash5tuplesorted
