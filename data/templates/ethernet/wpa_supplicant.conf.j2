# For UNIX domain sockets (default on Linux and BSD): This is a directory that
# will be created for UNIX domain sockets for listening to requests from
# external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and configuration.
# The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so multiple
# wpa_supplicant processes can be run at the same time if more than one
# interface is used.
# /var/run/wpa_supplicant is the recommended directory for sockets and by
# default, wpa_cli will use it when trying to connect with wpa_supplicant.

# IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL version
# wpa_supplicant is implemented based on IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 which defines
# EAPOL version 2. However, there are many APs that do not handle the new
# version number correctly (they seem to drop the frames completely). In order
# to make wpa_supplicant interoperate with these APs, the version number is set
# to 1 by default. This configuration value can be used to set it to the new
# version (2).
# Note: When using MACsec, eapol_version shall be set to 3, which is
# defined in IEEE Std 802.1X-2010.

    # For wired IEEE 802.1X authentication, "allow_canned_success=1" can be
    # used to configure a mode that allows EAP-Success (and EAP-Failure) without
    # going through authentication step. Some switches use such sequence when
    # forcing the port to be authorized/unauthorized or as a fallback option if
    # the authentication server is unreachable. By default, wpa_supplicant
    # discards such frames to protect against potential attacks by rogue
    # devices, but this option can be used to disable that protection for cases
    # where the server/authenticator does not need to be authenticated.

    # "tls_disable_tlsv1_0=0" is used to allow TLSv1 for compatibility with
    # legacy networks. This follows the behavior of Debian's wpa_supplicant,
    # which includes a custom patch for allowing TLSv1, but the patch currently
    # does not work for VyOS' git builds of wpa_supplicant.
