"""
Retrieves (or at least attempts to retrieve) the total number of real CPU cores
installed in a Linux system.

The issue of core count is complicated by existence of SMT, e.g. Intel's Hyper Threading.
GNU nproc returns the number of LOGICAL cores,
which is 2x of the real cores if SMT is enabled.

The idea is to find all physical CPUs and add up their core counts.
It has special cases for x86_64 and MAY work correctly on other architectures,
but nothing is certain.
