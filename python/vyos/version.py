VyOS version data access library.

VyOS stores its version data, which include the version number and some
additional information in a JSON file. This module provides a convenient
interface to reading it.

Example of the version data dict::
  {
   'built_by': 'autobuild@vyos.net',
   'build_id': '021ac2ee-cd07-448b-9991-9c68d878cddd',
   'version': '1.2.0-rolling+201806200337',
   'built_on': 'Wed 20 Jun 2018 03:37 UTC'
  }

    The optional ``file`` argument comes in handy in upgrade scripts
    that need to retrieve information from images other than the running image.
    It should not be used on a running system since the location of that file
    is an implementation detail and may change in the future, while the interface
    of this module will stay the same.
