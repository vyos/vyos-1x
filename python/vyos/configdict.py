A library for retrieving value dicts from VyOS configs in a declarative fashion.

def retrieve_config(path_hash, base_path, config):

    Retrieves a VyOS config as a dict according to a declarative description

    The description dict, passed in the first argument, must follow this format:
    ``field_name : <path, type, [inner_options_dict]>``.

    Supported types are: ``str`` (for normal nodes),
    ``list`` (returns a list of strings, for multi nodes),
    ``bool`` (returns True if valueless node exists),
    ``dict`` (for tag nodes, returns a dict indexed by node names,
    according to description in the third item of the tuple).

    Args:
        path_hash (dict): Declarative description of the config to retrieve
        base_path (list): A base path to prepend to all option paths
        config (vyos.config.Config): A VyOS config object

    Returns:
        dict: config dict
