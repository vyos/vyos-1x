    The VXLAN protocol is a tunnelling protocol designed to solve the
    problem of limited VLAN IDs (4096) in IEEE 802.1q. With VXLAN the
    size of the identifier is expanded to 24 bits (16777216).

    VXLAN is described by IETF RFC 7348, and has been implemented by a
    number of vendors.  The protocol runs over UDP using a single
    destination port.  This document describes the Linux kernel tunnel
    device, there is also a separate implementation of VXLAN for
    Openvswitch.

    Unlike most tunnels, a VXLAN is a 1 to N network, not just point to
    point. A VXLAN device can learn the IP address of the other endpoint
    either dynamically in a manner similar to a learning bridge, or make
    use of statically-configured forwarding entries.

    For more information please refer to:
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vxlan.txt
